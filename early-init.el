;;; Commentary:

;;; Code:

;; Defer garbage collection further back in the startup process
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum)

;; make sure native-comp-eln-load-path under `user-emacs-directory'
(setq native-comp-eln-load-path `(,(concat user-emacs-directory "eln-cache/")))

;; Package initialize occurs automatically, before `user-init-file' is
;; loaded, but after `early-init-file'. We handle package
;; initialization, so we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; Inhibit resizing frame
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)

;; Prevent the glimpse of un-styled Emacs by disabling these UI elements early.
